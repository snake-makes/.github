## wassup. ðŸ‘‹

we're **"snake makes"**. an org where all our projects get created and constantly reimagined.
our organization community consists of mostly pythoneers and frontend-developers.

any projects that are visible to guests are open-sourced and free for non-commercial use.
if you decide to use them, please remember to credit the organization and the OP.

when the community of snake-makes grows, we will publish the site and docs to our open-source projects.

sending rays of love! ðŸ’š
